1. Use HTTPS for All Communications
This ensures that all communication between the client and server is encrypted, protecting sensitive data like login credentials and tokens.
2. Secure Your JWT Tokens
Expiration: Set a short expiration time (e.g., 30 minutes). Use refresh tokens to avoid forcing users to log in repeatedly.
Signing: Use a strong RSA key pair to sign your JWTs and ensure the token's integrity.
Token Validation: Always validate the issuer, audience, and signature of the JWT.
3. Enable CSRF Protection (Where Applicable)
For non-API endpoints (like web forms), enable CSRF protection to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
4. Limit Login Attempts
Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. You can lock out users after a certain number of failed login attempts or introduce CAPTCHAs.
